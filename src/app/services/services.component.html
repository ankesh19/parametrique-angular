                  <h1>MANDATORY ACCESS CONTROL (MAC)</h1>
                  <p>In MAC, users do not have much freedom to determine who has access
                     to their files. For example, security clearance of users and classification 
                     of data (as confidential, secret or top secret) are used as security labels to
                     define the level of trust.

                <h1>DISCRETIONARY ACCESS CONTROL (DAC)</h1>
                <p>In DAC, the data owner determines who can access specific resources. For example, 
                    a system administrator may create a hierarchy of files to be accessed based on 
                    certain permissions.

                <h1>ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL (RBAC)</h1>
                <p>RBAC allows access based on the job title. For example, a human resources 
                    specialist should not have permissions to create network accounts; this 
                    should be a role reserved for network administrators.
